#Huffman Compression and Decompression Algorithm
The code is written in MS Visual Studio IDE. THe code runs only for text files. On running the main function, user is asked to enter a .txt file which is then compressed to a ".bin" file with name "Compressed.bin" in the same folder. Similarly the next prompt is to enter a .bin file for decompression which is decompressed to a text file with name "Decompress.txt" in the same folder.
